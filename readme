# Part 1 – Operational Robustness Study under Missing Data

## 🎯 Objective

This project evaluates the operational robustness of multiple classification models under different missing data mechanisms.

The classifier is trained once on clean data and then evaluated on corrupted test data after applying different imputation strategies.

The goal is to measure how well the same trained model survives input degradation.

## 🧪 Experimental Design

### 1️⃣ Data Split
- Train/Test split performed once.
- Training data remains clean.
- Test data is corrupted during evaluation.

### 2️⃣ Missing Mechanisms
- MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)
- MAR (Missing At Random)
- MNAR (Missing Not At Random)

Missing rates tested:
- 10%
- 20%
- 30%
- 50%
- 70%

### 3️⃣ Imputation Methods
- Zero-Fill (baseline degradation)
- Mean Imputation
- KNN Imputation
- MICE (Iterative Imputer)
- Autoencoder-based Imputation

### 4️⃣ Models Evaluated
- Random Forest
- KNN
- MLP
- 1D CNN
- Transformer Encoder

## 🔁 Operational Robustness Protocol

1. Train classifier on clean training data.
2. Train Autoencoder on clean training data.
3. For each missing mechanism and rate:
   - Corrupt test data only.
   - Apply imputation.
   - Evaluate using the same trained classifier.
4. Log metrics and generate robustness curves.
